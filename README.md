# orionsdk-python_scripts
A collection of scripts that leverage the [orionsdk-python](https://github.com/solarwinds/orionsdk-python) project hosted by SolarWinds. See that project for
help on getting everything setup to be able to use these scripts.

I'll be dropping any scripts I create for working with the orionsdk here in case they're helpful for you. Please do share your thoughts on pull requests! I know I
have room to improve on making them more pythonic, amongst other things, so please do provide suggestions.
